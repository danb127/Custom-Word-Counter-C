### 📖 Project Overview:
Welcome to the showcase of C programming prowess, where the Custom Word Count Utility project stands as a testament to the power of raw file I/O, dynamic memory management, and meticulous text parsing. This repository is your gateway to exploring a detailed implementation of a word count utility, designed to offer insights into manual buffer management and efficient memory use in C programming.

### 🗂 Repository Structure:
- **src/**: Home to the C source files that form the backbone of our utility.
- **doc/**: Contains detailed documentation, including the project's specifications and implementation notes.
- **bin/**: The compiled binaries and executable files, resulting from the project compilation.

### 📘 Documentation:
Dive deep into the essence of our project with comprehensive documentation. From implementation strategies to optimization details, everything you need to grasp the utility's scope and depth is here.

### 🔧 Setup and Execution Guide:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - `git clone [repository URL]`. Replace `[repository URL]` with the actual URL of this GitHub repository.

2. **Compile the Utility**:
   - Navigate to the project directory and run `make`. This compiles the source code into an executable named `wc`, employing strict compiler flags for optimal standards compliance and error handling.

3. **Run the Word Count**:
   - Execute `./wc path/to/your/file.txt` to count the words in your specified text file. The utility outputs the total word count, providing a reliable measure of text content.

### 📝 Note:
This guide assumes a basic familiarity with C programming and compilation. For detailed instructions on specific steps or troubleshooting, refer to the provided documentation and comments within the source code.
